            <li class="list">HTML project</li>
            
            <!-- After the HTML course we were tasked with creating a simple website for a .The Little Taco Shop  using html only.It was Fun! -->
            <li class="list">CSS project</li>
            <!-- 
            After completing the Html course we started the CSS course which taught us how to style websites and add desired designs.After the course we did a project which entailed class="mental">styling the website for the little taco shop.This was very engaging as compared to the HTML project -->
            <li class="list">TailwindCSS project</li>
            
            <!-- For this project we were tasked with creating a website known as Acme Rockets using TailwindCSS which for me was far much easier than the css project but it was equally engaging  -->
